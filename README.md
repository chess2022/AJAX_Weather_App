# AJAX_Weather_App
Simple Weather App using html, css and javascript

Uses openweathermap.org APIs for both the geographic coordinates by city name and then the weather by coordinates. 

This project was created to practice with jQuery and ajax to make api calls. 
My api keys are shown in the code, but in practice, DO NOT DO THIS.
